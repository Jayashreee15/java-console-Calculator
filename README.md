# java-console-Calculator â€“- A Hands-On Learning Project
  Java Console Calculator

 
 # About This Project

This is a menu-driven console calculator built in Java.
I created it as part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in:

Java fundamentals (methods, loops, conditionals)

Error handling (graceful divide-by-zero)

User interaction with console-based programs


The calculator is simple, clean, and keeps running until the user decides to exit.

# Features

Simple Operations â€“ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

Modular Methods â€“ Each operation is implemented in its own reusable method

Error Handling â€“ Division by zero handled gracefully with a user-friendly message

Loop for Multiple Calculations â€“ Continue until the user selects exit (y/n)

User-Friendly Output â€“ Clear and consistent messages for a smooth experience
